# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS TO FIX VERCEL DASHBOARD

## Current Status
‚úÖ **New Agent Inbox integration code created**  
‚úÖ **New Flask app deployed locally**  
‚ùå **Environment variables not set**  
‚ùå **Cron job not running**  
‚ùå **Vercel not updated**

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel dashboard and add these environment variables:

```bash
AGENT_INBOX_URL=https://dev.agentinbox.ai
AGENT_INBOX_ID=email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail
AGENT_INBOX_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real Agent Inbox API key!

### Step 2: Deploy the New App

The new app is already copied, but you need to commit and push:

```bash
cd agents-from-scratch
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Agent Inbox integration to fix dashboard"
git push
```

### Step 3: Set Up Cron Job on Your Server

```bash
cd agents-from-scratch
./setup_agentinbox_cron.sh
```

When prompted, enter your email address.

## üîç WHY THE DASHBOARD ISN'T SHOWING NUMBERS

The dashboard is currently showing 0s because:

1. **No emails are being ingested** (cron job not running)
2. **Agent Inbox connection failing** (no API key)
3. **Vercel still using old app** (not deployed)

## üìä WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER DEPLOYMENT

1. **Vercel will use the new app** that integrates with Agent Inbox
2. **Cron job will fetch emails every 5 minutes** from Gmail
3. **Emails will be sent to Agent Inbox** for processing
4. **Dashboard will show real-time statistics** from Agent Inbox
5. **Numbers will update automatically** as emails are processed

## üß™ TEST THE INTEGRATION

After setting environment variables, test locally:

```bash
cd agents-from-scratch
uv run python quick_test.py
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Agent Inbox Parser  
- ‚úÖ Ingest Script

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Dashboard Still Shows 0s:

1. **Check Vercel logs** for errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Test Agent Inbox connection** manually
4. **Check if cron job is running** on your server

### If Agent Inbox Connection Fails:

1. **Verify your API key** is correct
2. **Check Agent Inbox URL** is accessible
3. **Ensure you have proper permissions** on Agent Inbox

## üìà EXPECTED DASHBOARD BEHAVIOR

After successful deployment:

- **Total Emails**: Will show actual email count
- **Processed**: Emails handled by Agent Inbox
- **HITL**: Emails requiring human intervention
- **Ignored**: Emails marked as not actionable
- **Waiting Action**: Emails pending processing

## ‚è∞ TIMELINE

- **Immediate**: Set environment variables in Vercel
- **5 minutes**: Deploy new app
- **10 minutes**: Set up cron job
- **15 minutes**: First emails should appear in dashboard
- **Ongoing**: Dashboard updates every 5 minutes

## üÜò NEED HELP?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Vercel deployment logs**
2. **Verify cron job is running**: `crontab -l`
3. **Test Agent Inbox connection**: Check the `/health` endpoint
4. **Review environment variables** in Vercel dashboard

The integration is designed to be robust with fallbacks, so even if some components fail, the dashboard will continue to function.
